            <p>Last updated: November 23rd, 2024 | Version 1.0</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Content Section -->
        <div class="terms-content">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                These Terms and Conditions (hereinafter referred to as "Terms and Conditions") constitute a legally binding agreement between ATA Private Limited
(hereinafter referred to as "Company," "us," "we," or "our," which includes its affiliates, successors, and assigns) and the individuals 
("Users," "you," or "your") using this website, accessible from https://xpcures.com/ ("Website"), the XPCURES application ("Application"), and the 
services managed by the Company, as applicable. By accessing and using the Website, Application, and services, you agree to comply with and be 
bound by these Terms and Conditions.
            </p>

            <h2>Service Usage Policy</h2>
            <p>
                XPCURES facilitates the connection between patients and qualified nurses for home care services through its platform. Once a booking is confirmed, both 
parties are expected to adhere to the agreed schedule. However, if a patient or nurse cancels the appointment after the nurse has already arrived, it 
disrupts the service workflow. In such cases, if the patient decides to proceed with care outside the XPCURES platform, any incidents, disputes, or issues 
that occur during or after the service will not be the responsibility of XPCURES.

To ensure a safe and seamless experience, users are encouraged to complete all transactions and communications within the app. This policy helps 
maintain accountability, data security, and quality assurance. Any deviation from this process may lead to complications for which XPCURES cannot 
provide support or mediation.

<br><br>Key Points to Note:
<li>Cancellations after nurse arrival void XPCURES' responsibility.</li>
<li>Care provided outside the platform is not monitored by XPCURES.</li>
<li>Users must report cancellations or issues through the app for resolution.</li>
<li>XPCURES ensures accountability only for services conducted within its platform.</li>
            </p>

            <h2>Scope of Nurse Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>
                Nurses on the XPCURES platform are strictly limited to providing care and treatment as outlined in the patient's booking. They are not authorized to offer medical
diagnoses, prescribe medications, or provide any services beyond their professional scope. Patients must refrain from requesting or pressuring nurses for such 
services, as this violates XPCURES’ guidelines.

Any unauthorized medical actions or diagnoses performed by a nurse outside the intended care are beyond the platform's responsibility. XPCURES will not be held 
liable for any advice, diagnosis, or treatment provided outside the platform’s approved services. Patients are advised to consult licensed medical professionals for 
any diagnostic or prescription needs.
            </p>

            <h2>Conduct & Professionalism</h2>
            <p>
                XPCURES emphasizes the importance of mutual respect and professionalism between patients and nurses to ensure a safe and comfortable environment for both
parties. Below are the key guidelines:
Respectful Interactions: Both patients and nurses must engage in courteous and respectful communication throughout their interactions.
Patient Hospitality: Patients are expected to provide a hospitable and supportive environment for the nurse during their visit. This includes basic courtesies such
     as timely communication and a safe, clean space for care.
Professional Service Delivery: Nurses are required to deliver their services with the highest level of professionalism, care, and adherence to the agreed care plan.

Legal Protection for Nurses
In cases of inappropriate behavior, harassment, or misconduct (including rude behavior or gender-based issues) by a patient toward a nurse, XPCURES will take the 
matter seriously. The platform reserves the right to pursue legal action against the offending patient to ensure justice and safeguard the nurse's well-being.
<br><br>The following measures will apply:
<li>Zero Tolerance Policy: Any form of harassment, including rude behavior or gender-based issues, will not be tolerated.</li>
<li>Right to Legal Action: XPCURES reserves the right to take legal action against patients involved in inappropriate behavior to protect the nurse's rights.</li>
<li>Compensation Claims: In severe cases, the platform may seek financial compensation on behalf of the affected nurse.</li>
<li>Incident Reporting: Nurses are encouraged to report incidents promptly through the platform’s reporting system for swift resolution.</li>
<li>Account Penalties: Patients found guilty of misconduct may face penalties, including account suspension or permanent removal from the platform.</li>

<br>These steps are designed to provide nurses with legal protection and uphold their professional dignity.
            </p>

            <h2>Booking Policy & Transparency</h2>
            <p>
                XPCURES aims to provide efficient and affordable care by encouraging patients to book the nearest available nurse. This not only ensures timely service but also 
helps minimize additional costs such as travel fees. Choosing a nurse from a farther location may result in higher charges, which will be reflected during the 
booking process. Patients are advised to check nurse availability within their area to optimize convenience and cost.

Additionally, XPCURES promotes a culture of transparency to build trust between patients and nurses. Open communication is key to a seamless care experience, 
and any concerns or misunderstandings should be addressed immediately. Patients and nurses can report disputes or issues directly through the platform, enabling
 XPCURES to mediate and resolve matters swiftly and fairly. This ensures that both parties feel supported and valued throughout the care journey.
