            <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
            <p>Last updated: November 23rd, 2024 | Version 1.0</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Content Section -->
        <div class="terms-content">
            <p>At XPCURE, we strive to ensure complete satisfaction with our services. However, we understand that there may be situations where users may request a refund due
              to various reasons such as cancellation, dissatisfaction, or any other issues with the service provided. Our refund policy is designed to be fair and transparent, offering
              clarity on when and how refunds can be issued. In general, refunds may be requested if the service is canceled within a specified time frame or if there was an issue 
              with the quality or availability of the care provided. However, certain conditions and limitations may apply, and we encourage users to refer to the specific terms for 
              each service to understand eligibility. All refund requests are reviewed on a case-by-case basis, ensuring that we take into account all relevant details, including the 
              nature of the issue, timing, and the type of service requested.
              
              <br><br>Refunds may be subject to deductions based on various factors, such as administrative charges, service delivery costs, and the timing of the cancellation. If the service 
              was rendered or partially completed, we may not be able to issue a full refund, but we will ensure that the amount refunded is reasonable and justifiable based on the
              circumstances. For instance, if a patient cancels a booking after the nurse has arrived, a partial refund or no refund at all may be provided, depending on the time 
              elapsed and other relevant factors. In cases of dissatisfaction with the service, we encourage users to communicate their concerns immediately, as we aim to resolve 
              issues swiftly and effectively, either through alternate care arrangements or by providing a partial or full refund, as appropriate. If a refund is granted, it will be 
              processed to the original payment method, and the time taken for the funds to appear will depend on the payment processor. We strive to offer a hassle-free refund 
              experience, and any disputes or issues will be handled professionally and promptly.</p>

                    <p>At XPCURE, we aim to provide the best care experience. However, there may be instances where refunds are necessary. Below are the terms for requesting refunds, 
                      eligibility criteria, and how to resolve issues.</p>

            <h2>1. Refund for Packages</h2>
            <p>Refunds can be requested within 48 hours of purchasing any package. After this 48-hour window, no refunds will be processed.
              <li>All refund requests must be submitted through the platform‚Äôs support system within the specified timeframe.</li></p>

            <h2>2. Nurse No-Show</h2>
            <p>If a nurse does not arrive for the scheduled appointment, a full refund will be initiated immediately.</p>

            <h2>3. Late Arrivals</h2>
            <p>If a nurse arrives significantly late, we will offer the following options:
              <li>Compensation (e.g., discounts on future services).</li>
              <li>Cancellation and Full Refund for the service.</li></p>

            <h2>4. False or Inaccurate Reports</h2>
            <p>All refund requests and disputes are thoroughly investigated. Providing false or inaccurate information when disputing fees or requesting refunds violates our Community 
              Guidelines. Consequences include:
              <li>Denial of your refund request.</li>
              <li>Account suspension or deactivation for repeat or fraudulent claims</li></p>

            <h2>5. Refund Processing Time</h2>
            <p>Once approved, refunds are typically processed within 7-10 business days and issued to the original payment method.</p>

            <h2>6. Non-Refundable Items</h2>
            <p>Services rendered outside of XPCURE‚Äôs app or payments made outside the platform are non-refundable, and we hold no responsibility for these transactions.</p>
            
            <h2>Eligibility for Full or Partial Refund</h2>
            <p><strong>Full Refund:</strong>
              <br>You are eligible for a full refund if:
              <li>The nurse did not arrive for the scheduled service.</li>
              <li>You cancel a package within 48 hours of purchase.</li>
              <li>The nurse arrives very late, and you opt for a full refund.</li>
              <br><strong>Partial Refund:</strong>
              <br>You may be eligible for a partial refund if:
              <li>The nurse arrived late but you opted to continue with the service and requested compensation instead of cancellation.</li>
              <li>The service was completed, but there were minor issues reported within a reasonable time.</li></p>
